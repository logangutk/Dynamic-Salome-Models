# Dynamic-Salome-Models
This script is a workaround for potential parametric modelling in Salome. Salome does not allow dynamic references in their *.py dump file. This program passes design table values taken from a simple spreadsheet and implements them into an executable Salome *.py file via a serialized JSON format.
